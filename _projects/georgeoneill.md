George graduated from the University of Nottingham with a Masters degree in Physics, where in his final project he was introduced to [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography). He went on to use the technology to complete a PhD at the [Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/index.aspx) under the supervision of [Matthew Brookes](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/matthew.brookes) investigating the [dynamic properties of functional networks in the brain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgeoneill/thesis/master/main.pdf). In 2016 he undertook his first postdoc in the lab of [Sue Francis](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/susan.francis) on the [Touchmap](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/research/touch-map/index.aspx) project, which investigated (dys)function in the somatosensory cortex using both MEG and 7T MRI. 

In 2019 he moved to UCL to work with [Gareth Barnes](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/meg-team/) in establishing the nascent [optically-pumped MEG](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2022.05.008) facility at the [Department of Imaging Neuroscience](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). During that time he also developed methods to improve imaging function originating from the hippocampus with MEG. A useful move it turns out, as now he has joined the Human Electrophysiology Lab to do just that on an array of modalities.
