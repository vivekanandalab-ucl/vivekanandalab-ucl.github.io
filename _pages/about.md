The UCL Human Electrophysiology lab investigates the mechanisms of human spatial and episodic memory function. Utilising intracranial EEG and single cell recordings from epilepsy patients (at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/national-hospital-neurology-and-neurosurgery)) and MEG recordings from healthy volunteers (at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/)) alongside computational modelling, we aim to elucidate the cellular and network level mechanisms that support the various mnemonic functions ascribed to the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe

We are based in the [UCL Division of Biosciences](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/ucl-biosciences) - one of the worldâ€™s foremost centres for research and teaching in the biological sciences and one of the largest Divisions within UCL. We benefit from close collaboration with the research groups of [Gareth Barnes](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/meg-team/), [Caswell Barry](https://barry-lab.com/), [Neil Burgess](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory), and [Matthew Walker](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/people/professor-matthew-walker)
